We explored Windows PowerShell to: Create folders (mkdir) Navigate directories (cd) Move, delete, and organize files We also practiced separating files (e.g., MP3s, PDFs) using scripts—early exposure to automation via scripting.

Scripting file organization revealed how much time is wasted on repetitive tasks, prompting me to audit my own workflows for automation opportunities.

Realized that education systems often teach software use but not how to bend tools to one’s will through scripting, a critical gap in digital literacy.

Reducing mundane tasks via automation doesn’t just save time—it frees mental bandwidth for creative or complex work, altering how I approach problem-solving.
