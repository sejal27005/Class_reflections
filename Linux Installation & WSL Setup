Installing WSL introduced me to Linux’s philosophy of transparency and user agency, contrasting sharply with proprietary systems that obscure functionality behind GUIs.

Learned that Stallman’s GNU project and Torvalds’ kernel represent a collaborative ethos often more innovative than corporate-driven development.

Initially resisted the command line as archaic but now see it as a purer form of human-computer interaction—one that demands understanding rather than obscuring it behind icons.
