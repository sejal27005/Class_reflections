Saw the CPU’s fetch-decode-execute cycle as a metaphor for human cognition, with the accumulator mirroring working memory and buses resembling urban infrastructure (address bus as postal system, data bus as highways).

Realized that computer architecture solves fundamental organizational problems akin to human societies, just through electrical signals rather than physical logistics.
Tracing a simple ADD instruction’s path through registers deepened my respect for the precision required in hardware design—each transistor’s state enabling calculations we take for granted.
