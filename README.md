# Notes and key takeaways from Unit 1: Software and Hardware Systems.

- Types of Computers
Personal Computers (PCs)- Designed for individual users; common in homes, schools, and offices.
Servers- Provide services and manage resources for client devices over a network.
Supercomputers- Extremely high-performance machines used for complex computations such as weather forecasting, molecular modeling, and AI research.


- Binary Number System
One of the most fundamental concepts in computing is the binary number system, which uses only two digits: 0 and 1.
Key Points:- 
1. All data in a computer, whether it's text, images, or sound, is ultimately represented in binary.
2. Each binary digit (bit) represents an on/off or true/false state.
3. Multiple bits are combined to form bytes and larger data types (e.g., integers, characters).
4. Binary arithmetic is essential for operations in the ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit).
Understanding binary is crucial because it underpins how computers perform calculations and represent data.


- Functional Units of a Computer
A computer consists of five major functional units:
 ~ Input Unit – Accepts user data through devices like keyboards and mice.
 ~ Output Unit – Displays or outputs processed results using monitors, printers, etc.
 ~ Memory Unit – Temporarily or permanently stores data and instructions.
 ~ Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) – Executes mathematical and logical operations.
 ~ Control Unit – Coordinates all other units by sending control signals.
